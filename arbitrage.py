''' What are the most important things we will consider in arbitrage bot? 
1. Market data: We need to fetch real-time market data from exchanges.
2. Trading pairs: We need to identify trading pairs that have price discrepancies.
3. Execution speed: We need to ensure fast execution of trades to take advantage of price discrepancies.
4. Risk management: We need to implement risk management strategies to protect our capital.
5. Fees and slippage: We need to account for trading fees and potential slippage when executing trades.
6. Capital allocation: We need to determine how much capital to allocate to each trade.
7. Monitoring: We need to continuously monitor the market for new opportunities.
